Hello, I'm Vincent Chang, a first year master student of Computer Science at Rice University. 
My background combines strong academic training with applied research and industry collaboration, preparing me to contribute effectively in machine learning engineering roles.

I finished my computer science bachelor degree in NYCU Taiwan, focusing on ****machine learni** and **reinforcement learning**. I have hands-on experience in deep learning, computer vision, and generative models, with projects ranging from indoor scene reconstruction to automatic video generator. 

Currently seeking a 2026 Summer internship in **Machine Learning Engineering** or **Applied Scientist**, where I can apply my skills in deep learning, computer vision, and data-driven area.
